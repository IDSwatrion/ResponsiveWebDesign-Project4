            <h2>Introduction</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            A semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value
            falling between that of a conductor, such as metallic copper, and an
            insulator, such as glass. Its resistivity falls as its temperature
            rises; metals are the opposite. Its conducting properties may be
            altered in useful ways by introducing impurities ("doping") into the
            crystal structure. When two differently-doped regions exist in the
            same crystal, a semiconductor junction is created. The behavior of
            charge carriers, which include electrons, ions and electron holes,
            at these junctions is the basis of diodes, transistors and all
            modern electronics. Some examples of semiconductors are silicon,
            germanium, gallium arsenide, and elements near the so-called
            "metalloid staircase" on the periodic table. After silicon, gallium
            arsenide is the second most common semiconductor and is used in
            laser diodes, solar cells, microwave-frequency integrated circuits
            and others. Silicon is a critical element for fabricating most
            electronic circuits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Semiconductor devices can display a range of useful properties, such
            as passing current more easily in one direction than the other,
            showing variable resistance, and sensitivity to light or heat.
            Because the electrical properties of a semiconductor material can be
            modified by doping, or by the application of electrical fields or
            light, devices made from semiconductors can be used for
            amplification, switching, and energy conversion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The conductivity of silicon is increased by adding a small amount
            (of the order of 1 in 108) of pentavalent (antimony, phosphorus, or
            arsenic) or trivalent (boron, gallium, indium) atoms. This process
            is known as doping and resulting semiconductors are known as doped
            or extrinsic semiconductors. Apart from doping, the conductivity of
            a semiconductor can equally be improved by increasing its
            temperature. This is contrary to the behaviour of a metal in which
            conductivity decreases with increase in temperature.
          </p>
          <p>
            The modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies
            on quantum physics to explain the movement of charge carriers in a
            crystal lattice. Doping greatly increases the number of charge
            carriers within the crystal. When a doped semiconductor contains
            mostly free holes it is called "p-type", and when it contains mostly
            free electrons it is known as "n-type". The semiconductor materials
            used in electronic devices are doped under precise conditions to
            control the concentration and regions of p- and n-type dopants. A
            single semiconductor crystal can have many p- and n-type regions;
            the pâ€“n junctions between these regions are responsible for the
            useful electronic behavior. Using a hot-point probe, one can
            determine quickly whether a semiconductor sample is p- or n-type.

              <h4>Variable electrical conductivity</h4>
              <div class="background">
                <p>
                  Semiconductors in their natural state are poor conductors
                  because a current requires the flow of electrons, and
                  semiconductors have their valence bands filled, preventing the
                  entire flow of new electrons. There are several developed
                  techniques that allow semiconducting materials to behave like
                  conducting materials, such as doping or gating. These
                  modifications have two outcomes: n-type and p-type. These
                  refer to the excess or shortage of electrons, respectively. An
                  unbalanced number of electrons would cause a current to flow
                  through the material.[4]
                </p>

            <li>
              <h4>Heterojunctions</h4>
              <p>
                Heterojunctions occur when two differently doped semiconducting
                materials are joined together. For example, a configuration
                could consist of p-doped and n-doped germanium. This results in
                an exchange of electrons and holes between the differently doped
                semiconducting materials. The n-doped germanium would have an
                excess of electrons, and the p-doped germanium would have an
                excess of holes. The transfer occurs until equilibrium is
                reached by a process called recombination, which causes the
                migrating electrons from the n-type to come in contact with the
                migrating holes from the p-type. A product of this process is
                charged ions, which result in an electric field.[1][4]
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Excited electrons</h4>
              <p>
                A difference in electric potential on a semiconducting material
                would cause it to leave thermal equilibrium and create a
                non-equilibrium situation. This introduces electrons and holes
                to the system, which interact via a process called ambipolar
                diffusion. Whenever thermal equilibrium is disturbed in a
                semiconducting material, the number of holes and electrons
                changes. Such disruptions can occur as a result of a temperature
                difference or photons, which can enter the system and create
                electrons and holes. The process that creates and annihilates
                electrons and holes are called generation and recombination.[4]

              <h4>Light emission</h4>
              <p>
                In certain semiconductors, excited electrons can relax by
                emitting light instead of producing heat.[5] These
                semiconductors are used in the construction of light-emitting
                diodes and fluorescent quantum dots.

              <h4>High thermal conductivity</h4>
              <p>
                Semiconductors with high thermal conductivity can be used for
                heat dissipation and improving thermal management of
                electronics.[6]

              <h4>Thermal energy conversion</h4>
              <p>
                Semiconductors have large thermoelectric power factors making
                them useful in thermoelectric generators, as well as high
                thermoelectric figures of merit making them useful in
                thermoelectric coolers.[7]

                effectively because they have 4 valence electrons in their

            Most common semiconducting materials are crystalline solids, but
            amorphous and liquid semiconductors are also known. These include
            hydrogenated amorphous silicon and mixtures of arsenic, selenium and
            tellurium in a variety of proportions. These compounds share with
            better known semiconductors the properties of intermediate
            conductivity and a rapid variation of conductivity with temperature,
            as well as occasional negative resistance. Such disordered materials
            lack the rigid crystalline structure of conventional semiconductors
            such as silicon. They are generally used in thin film structures,
            which do not require material of higher electronic quality, being
            relatively insensitive to impurities and radiation damage.

            Semiconductors are defined by their unique electric conductive
            behavior, somewhere between that of a conductor and an insulator.[9]
            The differences between these materials can be understood in terms
            of the quantum states for electrons, each of which may contain zero
            or one electron (by the Pauli exclusion principle). These states are
            associated with the electronic band structure of the material.
            Electrical conductivity arises due to the presence of electrons in
            states that are delocalized (extending through the material),
            however in order to transport electrons a state must be partially
            filled, containing an electron only part of the time.[10] If the
            state is always occupied with an electron, then it is inert,
            blocking the passage of other electrons via that state. The energies
            of these quantum states are critical, since a state is partially
            filled only if its energy is near the Fermi level (see Fermiâ€“Dirac
            statistics).

            <h2>Early history of semiconductors</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            The history of the understanding of semiconductors begins with
            experiments on the electrical properties of materials. The
            properties of negative temperature coefficient of resistance,
            rectification, and light-sensitivity were observed starting in the
            early 19th century.
            <br />
            Thomas Johann Seebeck was the first to notice an effect due to
            semiconductors, in 1821.[16] In 1833, Michael Faraday reported that
            the resistance of specimens of silver sulfide decreases when they
            are heated. This is contrary to the behavior of metallic substances
            such as copper. In 1839, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel reported
            observation of a voltage between a solid and a liquid electrolyte
            when struck by light, the photovoltaic effect. In 1873 Willoughby
            Smith observed that selenium resistors exhibit decreasing resistance
            when light falls on them. In 1874, Karl Ferdinand Braun observed
            conduction and rectification in metallic sulfides, although this
            effect had been discovered much earlier by Peter Munck af
            Rosenschold (sv) writing for the Annalen der Physik und Chemie in
            1835,[17] and Arthur Schuster found that a copper oxide layer on
            wires has rectification properties that ceases when the wires are
            cleaned. William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day observed the
            photovoltaic effect in selenium in 1876.[18]
